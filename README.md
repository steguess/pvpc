PVPC is a regulated tariff for households

# Description of the PVPC tariff

PVPC is a regulated tariff for households. This tariff is calculated adding several costs to the wholesale spot (hourly) prices and hence it is a variable tariff. However these added costs are variable as well, and hence, the daily pattern of PVPC prices is not exactly the same than the SPOT prices. 

In the current context of volatile electricity prices, we are interested in obtaining hourly prices of electricity and studying the daily spread (max price-min price of the day) for a household with the regulated tariff in Spain. The evolution of this spread is a key parameter for the analysis of profitability of investing in distributed energy storage.  

The regulated households tariff (voluntary price for the small consumers) is called PVPC and is linked to the wholesale market price and published by REE (Spanish Transport System Operator)
